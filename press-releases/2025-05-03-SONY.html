            <p class="article-paragraph">            
                <i>GLOBAL</i> — Prior to his trial, rapper ATAAH KING was in development talks with Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music, via AWAL<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> and The Orchard<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, to release his forthcoming album <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin’</i><sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> <i>2</i>. The album was intended to follow a bold campaign known as the “<i>Year-Long Singles Run Project</i>,” in which ATAAH would release a new single every week for a year.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The project was abruptly halted due to legal challenges, and ATAAH’s increasingly independent—but what was deemed at the time as "risky"—moves, which led Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> to restrict his access to their publishing dashboard.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Following his release, ATAAH was picked up by Roc Nation<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, securing crucial industry support after an intentionally subdued rollout of his <i>Comprehend 2</i> single through SoundOn<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>. While the track didn’t achieve massive numbers immediately, it achieved viral success in terms of listener impact, sparking a resonant and culturally significant reaction.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This approach allowed ATAAH to build authentic momentum—prioritizing connection over chart metrics—and led to a lasting collaboration with JUSS JABZZ, a key figure in the rollout who serves as an executive for the Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> label, according to a Business Proposal<a class="plus-sign" href="https://reignsoundrecords.github.io/documents/proposals/BPfCL/JUSSJABZZ/index.html">+</a> drafted on February 24, 2025. Their partnership remains central to the label’s creative direction and long-term vision, now backed by STRM<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music, a cutting-edge S&#227;o Paulo-based record label in Brazil.
            </p>
                
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                ATAAH is planning to rejoin Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>.
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                An internal memo shared with Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> labelmate IIIAMDESS confirms that a formal reach-out is scheduled for this upcoming week.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This renewed effort seeks to rebuild ties and gain the structural backing necessary for upcoming releases—especially as ATAAH’s presence grows globally.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records, currently led by JUSS JABZZ, is also drafting new contracts to bring members of ATAAH’s team back on board in key roles. Additionally, official partnership roles are being developed with Grillz by Scotty<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> (GBS), as well as other culturally relevant brands such as the <i>LIVE on Edgewood</i> and <i>Indie on Edgewood</i> series, to support the growth of newly signed Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> artists.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <span style="font-weight: 555;">For the RECORD</span><sup class="recording-symbol">&#9679;</sup><span style="vertical-align: 0.1rem;">:</span><br/> <i>Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> recognizes the current absence of expanded internal coverage surrounding breakout artist IIIAMDESS, which is not due to oversight, but rather a strategic decision as the label ensures both flagship artists—ATAAH KING and IIIAMDESS—are positioned solidly before ramping up additional campaigns.</i>
            </p>
                
            <p class="article-paragraph">  
                <i>During a recent Twitch<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> LIVE broadcast titled <i>Cook w Khyra</i><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.twitch.tv/iiiiamdess">+</a>, hosted by IIIAMDESS, IIIAMDESS was seen comfortably engaging with her audience while enjoying what appeared to be a STIIIZY<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> or similarly branded personal item—offering a glimpse into her ease, focus, and continued productivity.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>While not diminishing the significance of ATAAH KING’s ongoing 30-day detox, IIIAMDESS's presence in the LIVE offered a sense of balance and perspective as ATAAH prepares for a focused return.</i>
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                It’s worth noting that ATAAH has not indicated any plans to part ways with weed entirely, but is currently on a personal break as he prepares to present his legal situation to organizations including the ACLU<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, NAACP<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Recently, IIIAMDESS led a successful DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> in New York City, collaborating with several well-known influencers and entertainers, and buzz is already building around an upcoming Texas DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup>—further details are expected to be shared soon. Expanded press and editorial coverage is on the way as well, to shed more light on IIIAMDESS’s evolution—from her early days with INFLUENCER CITY's Bratz House<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zhoaDUZQ0Y&list=PLAnhQmBk-b3hPvhqgL9iDQa7UdG2N7C6M&ab_channel=INFLUENCERCITY">+</a> to her growing influence as a flagship artist under Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup>.</i>

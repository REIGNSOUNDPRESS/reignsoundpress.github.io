            <p class="published-date">Saturday, May 3, 2025</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">            
                <i>GLOBAL</i> — Prior to his trial, ATAAH KING, the <i>NOT ONE</i><sup class="trademarking">SM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ATAAH+KING+NOT+ONE">+</a> and <i>FAVORITE RAPPER</i><sup class="trademarking">SM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ATAAH+KING+FAVORITE+RAPPER">+</a> rapper, was in talks with Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music, via AWAL<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> and The Orchard<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, regarding the release of his forthcoming project <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin’</i><sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> <i>2</i>.<sup>*</sup>
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">  
                The album was intended to follow a promotional campaign titled the <i>Year-Long Singles Run Project</i>,<sup>*</sup> in which ATAAH would release a new single every week for a year.<sup>*</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The project was abruptly halted due to legal challenges and ATAAH’s increasingly independent—yet, at the time, deemed "risky"—moves, which, in light of the recent acquisition of the label, prompted Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> to impose increased restrictions on the rapper's access to the AWAL<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> music distribution portal—inadvertently, temporarily disrupting the rollout.<sup>*</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Following his release, stemming from a wrongful conviction, and after an intentionally subdued delivery of his single <i>Comprehend 2</i> through SoundOn<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, ATAAH was picked up by Roc Nation<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, securing industry support through the provision of a guaranteed outlet to continue distributing music.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130376905">1</a>]</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Meeting traditional market benchmarks were not prioritized for this project; however, it still proved to be a record ahead of its time—resonating deeply and setting a new standard for cultural impact that continues to shape current industry trajectory.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/reignsound-press-290504472/3786774507163-reignsoundxl-just-trollin-ataah-king-grillz-by-scotty-iiiamdess-and-juss-jabzz">2</a>]</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This approach allowed ATAAH to build authentic momentum—prioritizing connection over chart metrics—and led to a lasting collaboration with JUSS JABZZ<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.newsbreak.com/reignsound-press-290504472/3747064369917-reignsound-news-cooking-with-jesus-inside-juss-jabzz-s-tiktok-worship-service">+</a>, a key figure in the rollout and an executive for the Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records label, according to a drafted Business Proposal.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://reignsoundrecords.github.io/documents/proposals/BPfCL/JUSSJABZZ/index.html">3</a>]</sup>
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This partnership remains central to the label’s creative direction and long-term vision, now backed by STRM<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.strmmusic.com/en">+</a>, a cutting-edge S&#227;o Paulo-based record label in Brazil.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130376905">1</a>]</sup>
            </p>
                
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The current aim is to reestablish alignment with Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music, and Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> is still actively exploring collaborative opportunities with music distribution teams and companies—including Sony's United Kingdom-based subsidiary, Robots + Humans<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.sonymusic.co.uk/label/robots-humans/">+</a>—as part of a diversified distribution and development strategy, alongside Universal Music Group's Motown<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Records<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.motownrecords.com/">+</a>.<sup>*</sup>
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                An internal memo shared with Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> labelmate IIIAMDESS<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iiiamdess+reignsound">+</a> confirms that a formal reach-out is scheduled for the upcoming week.<sup>*</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This renewed effort seeks to rebuild ties and gain the structural backing necessary for upcoming releases—as Reignsound’s presence grows globally.<sup>*</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records, currently led by JUSS JABZZ, is also in the process of bringing key members back on board. Grillz by Scotty<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> (GBS)<a class="plus-sign" href="https://reignsoundrecords.github.io/documents/proposals/BPfCL/GRILLZBYSCOTTY/index.html">+</a>, operated by Atlanta rapper and businessman Scotty ATL and Micah Kiyo, performing artist and FEMININE ENERGY 101 CEO, and other culturally relevant brands—including the <i>LIVE on Edgewood</i><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0AQcPPllQ&list=PLz5mEIDY99O6lC2raZbXCwsAWo90yADGK">+</a> and <i>Indie on Edgewood</i><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL13XIiExKs&list=PLgN0Xg0jzO_X1GhRtn4yxnoOYzIuz9upM">+</a> series—are strategic pillars integrated to support broader growth initiatives.<sup>*</sup>

            </p>
                
            <p class="article-paragraph">  
                <i>During a recent Twitch<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> LIVE stream titled "Cook w Khyra,"<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2448915551">+</a> hosted by IIIAMDESS; IIIAMDESS gave viewers a snapshot of where she's at creatively and personally.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Without taking away from the significance of ATAAH’s ongoing month-long detox, IIIAMDESS’s DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> series offers a complementary and harmonious counterbalance as ATAAH prepares to resume working on music full-time.</i>
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>It’s worth noting that ATAAH has not publicly indicated any plans to part ways with weed entirely, but is currently on a personal break as he prepares to present his legal situation to organizations including the ACLU<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, NAACP<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law—with the goal of having them re-present his case to the United States' Department of Justice.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Recently, IIIAMDESS led a successful DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> in the greater New York City area, collaborating with several other well-known influencers and entertainers, and buzz is already building around the Texas DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.twitch.tv/iiiiamdess">+</a>—with further details expected to be shared soon.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Expanded press and editorial coverage is on the way as well, to shed more light on IIIAMDESS’s evolution—from her earlier days with INFLUENCER CITY's Bratz House<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zhoaDUZQ0Y&list=PLAnhQmBk-b3hPvhqgL9iDQa7UdG2N7C6M&ab_channel=INFLUENCERCITY">+</a> to her growing influence as the flagship artist under the Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records imprint.</i>

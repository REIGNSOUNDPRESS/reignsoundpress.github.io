            <p class="article-paragraph">            
                <i>GLOBAL</i> — Prior to his trial, ATAAH KING, the "NOT ONE"<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ATAAH+KING+NOT+ONE">+</a> and "FAVORITE RAPPER"<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ATAAH+KING+FAVORITE+RAPPER">+</a> rapper was in talks with Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music, via AWAL<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> and The Orchard<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, regarding the release of his forthcoming album <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin’</i><sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> <i>2</i>. The album was intended to follow a promotional campaign titled the “<i>Year-Long Singles Run Project</i>,” in which ATAAH would release a new single every week for a year.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The project was abruptly halted due to legal challenges and ATAAH’s increasingly independent—yet, at the time, deemed "risky"—moves, which, in light of the recent acquisition of the label, prompted Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> to impose increased restrictions on the rapper's access to the AWAL<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> music distribution portal—inadvertently, temporarily disrupting the rollout.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Following his release from jail stemming from a wrongful conviction and after an intentionally subdued delivery of his single <i>Comprehend 2</i> through SoundOn<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, ATAAH was picked up by Roc Nation<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, securing additional industry support. 
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Meeting traditional industry benchmarks were not prioritized for this project; however, it still proved to be a record ahead of its time—resonating deeply and setting a new standard for cultural impact that continues to shape current industry trajectory.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This approach allowed ATAAH to build authentic momentum—prioritizing connection over chart metrics—and led to a lasting collaboration with JUSS JABZZ, a key figure in the rollout and an executive for the Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records label, according to a Business Proposal<a class="plus-sign" href="https://reignsoundrecords.github.io/documents/proposals/BPfCL/JUSSJABZZ/index.html">+</a> drafted on February 24, 2025.
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Their partnership remains central to the label’s creative direction and long-term vision, now backed by STRM<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music, a cutting-edge S&#227;o Paulo-based record label in Brazil.
            </p>
                
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The current aim is to reestablish alignment with Sony<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Music and ATAAH is still actively exploring collaborative opportunities with music distribution teams and companies—including Sony's United Kingdom-based subsidiary, Robots + Humans<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup>—as part of a diversified distribution and development strategy, alongside Universal Music Group's Motown<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> Records.
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                An internal memo shared with Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> labelmate IIIAMDESS confirms that a formal reach-out is scheduled for this upcoming week.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This renewed effort seeks to rebuild ties and gain the structural backing necessary for upcoming releases—especially as ATAAH’s presence grows globally.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records, currently led by JUSS JABZZ, is also drafting contracts to bring key members back on board. Additionally, Grillz by Scotty<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> (GBS) and other culturally relevant brands—such as the <i>LIVE on Edgewood</i> and <i>Indie on Edgewood</i> series—are strategic pillars being integrated to support broader growth initiatives.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <span style="font-weight: 555;">For the RECORD</span><sup class="recording-symbol">&#9679;</sup><span style="vertical-align: 0.1rem;">:</span><br/> <i>Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> recognizes the current absence of expanded internal coverage surrounding breakout artist IIIAMDESS, which is not due to "undersight," but rather a tactical decision as the label ensures both flagship artists—ATAAH KING and IIIAMDESS—are positioned solidly before ramping up additional campaigns.</i>
            </p>
                
            <p class="article-paragraph">  
                <i>During a recent Twitch<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> LIVE stream titled "Cook w Khyra,"<a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.twitch.tv/iiiiamdess">+</a> hosted by IIIAMDESS; IIIAMDESS gave viewers a snapshot of where she's at creatively and personally.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Without taking away from the significance of ATAAH KING’s ongoing month-long detox, IIIAMDESS’s DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> series offers a complementary and harmonious counterbalance as ATAAH prepares to resume working on music full-time.</i>
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>It’s worth noting that ATAAH has not publicly indicated any plans to part ways with weed entirely, but is currently on a personal break as he prepares to present his legal situation to organizations including the ACLU<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, NAACP<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law—with the goal of having them re-present his case to the United States' Department of Justice.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Recently, IIIAMDESS led a successful DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> in New York City, collaborating with several other well-known influencers and entertainers, and buzz is already building around the Texas DESSATHON<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup>—with further details expected to be shared soon.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                <i>Expanded press and editorial coverage is on the way as well, to shed more light on IIIAMDESS’s evolution—from her earlier days with INFLUENCER CITY's Bratz House<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup><a class="plus-sign" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zhoaDUZQ0Y&list=PLAnhQmBk-b3hPvhqgL9iDQa7UdG2N7C6M&ab_channel=INFLUENCERCITY">+</a> to her growing influence as the flagship artist under the Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records imprint.</i>

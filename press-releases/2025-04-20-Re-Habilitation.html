                <i>GLOBAL</i> - ATAAH KING, Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records rapper known for his polarizing honesty and cryptic lyricism, has just made a statement that has both supporters and insiders paying attention:<br>

            </p>
              
            <blockquote>

                "I'ma go a month without lightin' one."
                <cite>― ATAAH KING</cite> (via memo to REIGNSOUNDXL<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup>)

            </blockquote>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                
                Delivered exclusively through REIGNSOUNDXL<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup>, the announcement isn’t just about taking a break from weed—but also indicative of a spiritual pivot, personal experiment, and perhaps even a cultural reset.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://reignsoundpress.github.io/press-releases/2025-01-17-JussJabzz.html">1</a>]</sup>

            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">

                This new phase builds on an earlier effort from the top of the year, when ATAAH participated in a Re:Habilitation pilot project by Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> leaning on community support to begin detoxing from regular consumption of marijuana.<sup class="superscript-digits"><a href="https://x.com/reignsoundrehab">[2]</a></sup> While that attempt planted seeds, this time ATAAH's taking a slightly different route—one that is more internally driven.

            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">

                With professional psychologists by his side and a deeper reliance on faith and God-given willpower, the rapper seems committed to redefining what recovery looks like in real-time.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://theblackwallsttimes.com/2023/11/20/carroll-county-cops-arrested-and-allegedly-assaulted-ataah-king/">3</a>]</sup>

            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">

                All the while, behind the scenes a larger story is unfolding: lawsuits citing civil rights violations and the formal launch of the Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> brand enterprise, including the official establishment of Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records.<sup class="superscript-digits">[<a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/reignsound-press-290504472/3786774507163-reignsound-news-ataah-king-grillz-by-scotty-iiiamdess-juss-jabzz-just-trollin">4</a>]</sup>

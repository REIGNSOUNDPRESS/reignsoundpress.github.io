                <i>GLOBAL</i> — REIGNSOUND<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> NEWS: ATAAH KING Preps Surprise EP “GEAR UP,” Speaks on Industry Isolation, Wrongful Conviction, and Future of Label.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Reignsound™ Records rapper and YouTuber ATAAH KING has announced plans for a surprise EP, tentatively titled GEAR UP, slated for release on June 17, 2025. The project serves as a warm-up to his much-anticipated Year-Long Singles Run (YLSR) — a campaign designed to showcase his return to regular music releases after years of silence and setbacks.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                While the title GEAR UP remains unofficial, the rapper, who typically prefers ten-character names like REIGNSOUND and SENIORITIS, may stick with the name as the rollout solidifies. At this time, it is unclear whether there will be promotional efforts surrounding the EP’s launch, as ATAAH continues to weigh how much attention he wants the project to attract while the label restructures. Notably, no promotional methods have been utilized for this or any previous project — including his past articles — with nothing yet shared or mentioned via social media. That said, this may begin to shift soon as the rapper has confirmed backing from Apple</sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> and Google</sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup>.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The EP will be backed by Reignsound℠ and STRM® Music, with initial distribution through UnitedMasters®, a platform that recently made headlines for shifting to daily artist payouts — a move ATAAH believes will change the game for independent musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                ATAAH continues to utilize TuneCore® for distribution, appreciating the financial flexibility offered by platforms like UnitedMasters®. “Artists can once again operate from a position where they have more creative control and financial freedom,” he said via internal memo.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This isn't just a musical move — “it’s sort of a personal revival.” ATAAH KING has kept a relatively low profile since his wrongful conviction in 2018, which he attributes in part to a fan-turned-stalker.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The rapper has remained cordial with the individual and declines to reveal their identity out of respect for their privacy, emphasizing that while he is committed to telling the truth, he prioritizes respecting their privacy. He notes that their relentless interference led to a breakdown in his ability to maintain both personal and professional relationsips and support systems &mdash; especially given the high profile nature of his celebrity.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                “Courts make decisions for the ‘betterment of society,’” he explained in a discussion with collaborators &mdash; not in defense of the courts or the American justice system, but matter-of-factly. “And sometimes that means they think it’s easier to silence someone than expose the truth," he added, opinionatively.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                According to ATAAH, this isolation made him an easy target for systemic injustice. Still, he doesn’t blame the individual entirely: “Everyone in the world was under pressure and people were doing what they felt they had to do to survive. I leave the judgment to God.”
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Over the past year, the rapper has been working closely with psychologists and industry personnel to thoroughly document the effects of his convictions — both for the sake of personal healing and systemic accountability.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Despite years of silence on social media and limited public engagement, ATAAH KING now feels prepared to speak plainly about his experience.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                In fact, his re-entry into the public eye was initially delayed by uncertainty surrounding his label’s internal structure. Earlier this year, ATAAH announced on NewsBreak® that he planned to sign the <i>NO FILTER</i> rapper IIIAMDESS, who has since relocated to Texas. That shift &mdash; combined with behind-the-scenes restructuring and areas where the government initially refused to step up &mdash; left ATAAH unsure how to fund and manage collaborative projects.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                But clarity has come. Queue JUSS JABZZ.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                There is an actual reason for ATAAH's temporary withdrawal from label leadership: the lack of sufficient media coverage surrounding the injustices he endured — and continues to endure — left the rapper no choice but to establish REIGNSOUND™ PRESS himself. Even with his own press company, ATAAH KING has spent the past seven months trying to convey the severity of his circumstances and intends to continue seeking justice while raising awareness about systemic injustices. He believes that, in time, he’ll be able to communicate everything necessary — with the ultimate goal being the betterment of society and fulfillment of "God's Plan."
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Interestingly, ATAAH credits direct support from the NewsBreak<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> staff in helping him prepare and distribute his story &mdash; even providing a framework that helped him begin experimenting with the inner workings of journalism. That collaboration was key in establishing REIGNSOUND™ PRESS — even though, to this day, none of the articles have been promoted through traditional or social media channels and the rapper has temporarily paused his collaboration with NewsBreak<sup class="trademark-r">&reg;</sup> as he establishes Reignsound Press<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> as it's own entity.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Still, the rapper makes it clear: while he’s committed to truth, advocacy, and transparency, he doesn’t plan to stray from the job God gave him — entertaining people. “I wanna give people the raw facts,” he says, “but I’m trying my best to do it without depressing noybody.”
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Through internal communication with labelmate IIIAMDESS, ATAAH is now considering stepping into a more executive role alongside JUSS JABZZ, allowing IIIAMDESS to serve as the flagship artist for the label.
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                While music will still be released under ATAAH’s name — especially during the YLSR campaign — he may temporarily pivot to support his label from behind the scenes.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                This isn’t the first time ATAAH has taken on a leadership role. Prior to his incarceration, the rapper directly supported nearly 50 artists, many of whom publicly defended him during trial proceedings. At one point, he even drafted plans to mentor up to 200 new artists.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                That initiative is now part of a beta project, focusing on the initial 200 artists until they're all on their feet, with plans to open the label up to the world after refining the process. ATAAH insists he remains committed to making sure “everyone who stood by [him] receives everything they need.”
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                On the distribution side, the deluxe edition of <i>GEAR UP</i> — a rare offering for an EP — is expected to be handled by Roc Nation®. Additionally, ATAAH remains in talks with Sony® regarding the legal clearance for <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin</i>’® <i>2</i>, a long-rumored album.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                After years of silence, isolation, and injustice, <i>GEAR UP</i> is more than just an EP — it’s a signal. The rapper is back in the driver’s seat, not just musically but mentally, spiritually, and structurally.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> is designed to function as both a service and an open-sourced record label. Just as America has often played a role in policing the world and providing foreign aid, music has similarly offered support to people globally. Reignsound™ aspires to be the "America of music" — a label available for anyone who strictly wants to be an artist without getting tied up in the social antics often placed on artists by labels trying to stay socially relevant. Here, the goal is to provide artists with everything they need and then simply allow the music to speak for itself. The blueprint is designed to allow every artist to be successful, but if they want to push to that next step or beyond, that’s solely on them. This approach eliminates any pressure or opportunity for wrongful exploitation, while still allowing artists full creative freedom through non-exclusive deals with the label, meaning they aren't contractually bound — "except for IIIAMDESS and JUSS JABZZ," the rapper adds, half-jokingly.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">
                The Reignsound Press<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> and REIGNSOUNDXL<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup> will continue to follow developments around the GEAR UP EP, YLSR project, and ATAAH KING’s evolving executive presence at Reignsound<sup class="trademarking">SM</sup> Records<sup class="trademarking">TM</sup>.
